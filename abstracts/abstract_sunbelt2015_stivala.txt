Abstract:

The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is a well-established
statistical model for analyzing social networks.  However, estimating
ERGM parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes
severe limits on the size of networks that can be fitted. Furthermore,
commonly used methods for computing such estimations are now based on
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that are inherently sequential, which
limits the ability to apply parallel computing.

Recently, a technique for using snowball sampling, called "conditional
estimation", and parallel computing has been shown to be able to
estimate ERGM parameters for undirected networks.  The key goal is to
make inferences about the presence of effects such as network closure
and homophily in networks that are too large (over 40 000 nodes) to
estimate social circuit or other more advanced ERGM specifications
directly.

Extending the technique to directed networks is not necessarily
straightforward, as it involves the use of snowball
sampling. (Snowball sampling doesn't capture inward links, so they can
be missing if unreciprocated.)  Here we describe a new method which
uses a variation of snowball sampling as a computational technique to
take samples from a very large, but known, directed (non-symmetric)
network, so that an appropriate conditional estimation algorithm can
be used to estimate ERGM parameters for many such samples in
parallel. This allows inferences about effects to be made in directed
networks far larger than previously possible.
