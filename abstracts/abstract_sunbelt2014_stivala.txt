Abstract:

The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is a useful statistical
model for analyzing social networks.  However, estimating ERGM
parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes
severe limits on the size of networks that can be fitted. Furthermore,
the best methods for computing such estimations are based on Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods that are inherently sequential, which limits
the ability to apply parallel computing.

Recently, it has been shown that conditional estimation can be used to
estimate ERGM parameters of a network by estimating parameters for
smaller conditionally independent subsets of the network.  One
convenient method of generating approximately independent subsets is
snowball sampling, and the conditional estimates of these samples may
then be taken as independent estimates of the same model, and pooled
using a weighted mean.

A consequence of this design is that estimation of a large number of
relatively small samples can be conducted in parallel, thereby not
only allowing estimation on much larger networks than previously
possible, but also allowing the application of parallel computing to
speed up the process.

Here we discuss our parallel implementations of ERGM parameter
estimation using snowball sampling to allow parameters for very large
networks to be estimated.  We show that meta-analysis can be used to
obtain estimates that adequately represent the data, by applying our
methods to simulated networks with known parameters, and also
demonstrate the application to networks that are too large to find
social circuit and other more advanced ERGM specification parameters
for directly.
