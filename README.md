# AcademicWebsite
Files (mostly PDF preprints and slides) for academic website. Useful because Google Sites now forces files (even PDF files) to be links to Google Drive which means the URLs are a meaningless mess, opens inside browser in some complicated viewer instead of simply allowing user to view or download, and also apparently many organizations block access to Google Drive, so storing website files there is a bad idea.

So using GitHub pages for this instead, following the advice in https://kevinhayeswilson.com/website.pdf
